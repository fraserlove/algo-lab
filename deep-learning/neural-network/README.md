# Neural Network Library
A neural network library built from the ground up. Implements the full gradient descent algorithm with backpropagation using the chain rule. This library follows Andrej Karpathy's [Micrograd engine](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd/tree/master).

Note that in order to use `graph.py` to visualise and debug backpropagation, the `graphviz` package must be installed on your system. This can be installed as follows:
```bash
brew install graphviz # macOS
sudo apt install graphviz # Ubuntu
```
