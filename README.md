# Python Algorithms and Simulations
This repository serves as a library for all my simulations and algorithms written in Python. Included are programs ranging from a solar system and gravity simulations to a sorting algorithm visualiser. 
All algorithms and simulations were implemented in Python by Fraser Love - me@fraser.love. For more detail into the different programs featured here go to: [fraser.love](https://fraser.love).
